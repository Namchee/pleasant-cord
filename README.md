Pleasantcord is a simple NSFW image auto moderation bot ðŸ¤– for Discord powered by [TensorFlow JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow/tfjs-node). On the inside, it uses a pretrained model provided by [nsfw.js](https://github.com/infinitered/nsfwjs) that is able to distinguish image category to several categories.

## FAQ

### What's the default behavior of `pleasantcord`?

By default, `pleasantcord` will classify any image contents as NSFW when it has `Hentai` or `Porn` label with more than 70% accuracy and delete it from any **text channel** that isn't configured to be a NSFW channel.

### Animated `webp` and `png` throw errors!

Discord cannot display them correctly, yet there's no way to distinguish them from normal non-animated one as they share the same header.

### The classification is incorrect!

I'm not the one who created the model, so I can't say anything about it. That being said, image classification is an ML algorithm which could produce false alarms from time to time, so false alarms are quite common occurence.

## Data Privacy

Technically, `pleasantcord` won't store any of your data. However when `pleasantcord` has encountered an error on your server, `pleasantcord` will store the stacktrace on the logging system which *may* include your personal data (which is 100% embeddable content). This is done to ensure easier error debugging and fixing.

When the issue has been detected, acknowledged, and analyzed, your personal data will **immediately** deleted. If you feel that your data is still stored on our system, ~~feel free to join our support server and contact the moderators directly.~~
