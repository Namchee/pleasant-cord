Pleasantcord is a simple NSFW image auto moderation bot ðŸ¤– for Discord powered by [TensorFlow JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow/tfjs-node). On the inside, it uses a pretrained [Inception V3 model](https://keras.io/api/applications/inceptionv3/) provided by [nsfw.js](https://github.com/infinitered/nsfwjs) that is able to distinguish image category to several categories.

The bot behavior can be controlled from the config file which is stored in `config.json`.

> For now, you have to deploy your own version of bot if you want to modify the configuration. Dashboard is on the backlog.

## Motivation

Discord has [NSFW Channel System](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000084051-NSFW-Channels-and-Content). Unfortunately, the system cannot prevent NSFW contents from being posted on SFW channels and content moderation must still be done manually by server administrator.

This bot aims to fix that by automatically detecting potential NSFW images and administer correct response to the posted content either by blurring the image or removing it altogether. To add a sense of detterence, the bot is equipped with simple moderation system that will kick or ban offenders after a certain limit which will refresh itself in a certain period of time. All those features are configurable from the config file.

## Installation

> This bot is still on active development. The API **may** break at any moment

Invite this bot to your server by clicking [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=750668307555942482&permissions=268445718&scope=bot).

The bot itself requires the following permission in your server, make sure to **check it all**:

- Manage Roles
- Manage Members
- Kick Members
- Ban Members
- Send Messages
- Manage Messages

**Do not check any other permissions, `pleasantcord` does not require more permissions**
## Development

### Requirements

1. Docker
2. Node v12 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to your freshly cloned git directory
3. Create a new `.env` file in the current directory
4. Fill the new `.env` file with the instructions on `.env.sample` file
5. Execute `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up` from your favorite terminal.

`imageUrl` | Image to be shown on rich message embeds. Should be same as the bot display picture from Discord's Developer Portal.
`prefix` | Prefix for various commands for the bot. Default: `pc!`
`confidence` | Threshold for NSFW content prediction. Any content will be moderated if the NSFW probability is higher than this value. Default: `0.75` (75 percent)
`deleteNSFW` | Determine if the bot should delete original content and repost the NSFW content by blurring it. Default: `true`
`strike.count` | Determine how many times should a member be warned when commiting a NSFW violation before being banned or kicked. Default: `3`
`strike.refreshPeriod` | Determine expiration time for member's violation in seconds. Set as `-1` if violation should remain permanent. Default: `3600` (1 hour)
`ban` | Determine if excess violators should be banned from the server instead of kicked. Default: `false`

## FAQ

### Can I use a custom moderation configuration for `pleasantcord`?

For now, no you can't. You must deploy your own bot instance and configure it yourself.

In the future, it will be possible to configure it from a web dashboard. Stay tuned!

### The classification is incorrect!

I'm not the one who created the model, so I can't say anything about it. That being said, image classification is an ML algorithm which could produce false alarms from time to time, so false alarms are quite common occurence.

If you feel that the moderation is too sensitive / lax, you must configure the bot yourself.

### Can the bot unban previously banned users?

This bot **DOES NOT** provide an `unban` command. Server administrators must unban the members themselves.
